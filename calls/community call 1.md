### Ryan's Qs (all about federated learning):
- What's the modern take on federated learning? How does this work? 
    - What are the tasks/model types which are generally trained in a federated style? 
    - What kind of privacy is being preserved (model weights, local data, etc)? 
    - Is distributed compute an important component of this, or is it really about contributing *with* private data?
    - Where does verifiable compute potentially fit in here? Is verifiable training necesssary or can we bootstrap?
    - Potential for data poisoning attacks? How to ensure signed data sources?
    - Federated learning applications? Intuition for framework around when it's useful or better than other training techniques?
